# Overview

I am a student at BYUI and am trying to further my knowledge in the software world. I am trying to learn 5 new things/languages for these next 4 months. 

We are building a software that will allow 4 people to play the game of Pong together. We will make it so that two people can play or 4 people can play together at the same time. 

We are creating this software to learn different software languages and how to properly develope our skills in the field of software and different coding languages.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
